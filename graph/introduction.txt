tree  is a special graph that has no cycle 

graph composed of node and edges. 

two nodes are adjacent if there is edge between these two nodes 

if the edge has direction, we call this graph directed graph. 

graph can be used to solve some interesting problems such as gps, or the shortest path between two nodes. 

topological sorting -->  finding the order  the projects or objects depending on each other. 


edge can also have weight. Weight can measure how strong the connection is. 

 


There are two ways to implement a grpah: 

a.   Adjacency Matrix

b.    Adjacency List
